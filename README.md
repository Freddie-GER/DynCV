# DynCV
Dynamic CV Enhancer

This is currently not being pursued for time constraints, but feel free to play around with it. 
The Idea is that you can upload a cv and a job posting, and get a match analysis as well as section by section assistant helping you to adress mismatches.

You will need your own OpenAI Compatible API key to make this work. 

Currently stuck at the optimization page.
